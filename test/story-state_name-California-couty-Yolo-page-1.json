Though he made enough to feed his family of 5 and have a roof over our heads, I saw the real beauty in the struggle. Fast forward to current time and I am now searching for ways to get more involved with my university. UC Davis has a tremendous amount of opportunity for its students. Coming in as a freshman, I knew I had to stand out and find membership in activities outside of studying. So, I decided to apply for the UC Davis EOP Street Team position and after going through the interview process was fortunate enough to get the internship. My job was to reach out to underprivileged communities and inform the younger generations about the wonders of college. I absolutely loved this. I was helping the people whose shoes I was once in. This is what it's all about for me. Work somewhere that makes you happy.","photo":"","author":{"id":755,"user":{"id":758,"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"SMS#23"},"photo":null,"employer":null,"occupation":null,"employed":true,"part_time":false,"anonymous":false},"anonymous":false},{"id":1080,"created_at":"2016-02-05T19:00:00.426937Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T22:16:24.678817Z","location":{"id":835,"zipcode":"95616","city":"Davis","county":"Yolo","state":"CA","lon":-121.64,"lat":38.48},"content":"While studying at the University, I felt that the structures of the classes were terrible. They were mostly big if they were science and math based or they were pretty impersonal if they were a liberal arts class. The science classes were too big and it was really difficult to find time to get a tutor with a full time job and feeling like an idiot because I know nothing after attending a class. The liberal arts classes were decently sized but the format of the classes were way too theoretical and nothing really concrete came from them. I could definitely understand the theories but when it came to upper division there was no bridge for me to help me apply my general education. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, after switching around my major many times and taking classes and classes that didn't really fit me, I finally found the major that I thought suited what I wanted to do as a lifelong career because I will have a lifelong debt after I graduate. When it came time to changing my major this last time. My advisor said that I had taken too many units and could not switch. \r\n\r\nI was in disbelief and reflected a lot within the week of realizing this  and decided that I have to withdraw with no B.A. in anything. I made this decision because I had no integrity with the major I was studying and i felt that it would be a lifelong burden to career a degree in sometime I didn't really care about.","photo":"https://storiesofsolidarity.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/241495_10100388643571993_6686465_o.jpg","author":{"id":750,"user":{"id":753,"first_name":"","last_name":"Justin"},"photo":null,"employer":null,"occupation":null,"employed":true,"part_time":false,"anonymous":false},"anonymous":false},{"id":1079,"created_at":"2016-02-05T18:58:47.902238Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T22:16:42.165638Z","location":{"id":835,"zipcode":"95616","city":"Davis","county":"Yolo","state":"CA","lon":-121.64,"lat":38.48},"content":"I tend to take work very serious. Serious but at the same time I know when and how to have fun. Entering UC Davis as a freshman, I was told that to stand out I really needed to \"do more.\" This meant that not everything I do with my time here has to do with studying. So, I took it upon myself to reach out and help similar types of communities that aided me in getting to Davis. I applied, got interviewed, and then hired in the UC Davis EOP program! Our main goal was to really just create any and all sorts of media that could inform younger generations about what college is all about. I had this internship for my entire freshman year and have kept in touch with just about every person I met. Working in environments you are passionate about makes it or breaks it.","photo":"","author":{"id":749,"user":{"id":752,"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Zaragoza"},"photo":null,"employer":null,"occupation":null,"employed":true,"part_time":false,"anonymous":false},"anonymous":false},{"id":1075,"created_at":"2016-02-05T18:56:20.572000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T18:57:50.548319Z","location":{"id":835,"zipcode":"95616","city":"Davis","county":"Yolo","state":"CA","lon":-121.64,"lat":38.48},"content":"Yesterday my employer saw me get burned pretty badly by the stove at Burger King & he just told me to rinse it in cold water & I'd be fine.","photo":"","author":{"id":745,"user":{"id":748,"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"SMS#16"},"photo":null,"employer":null,"occupation":null,"employed":true,"part_time":false,"anonymous":false},"anonymous":false},{"id":1073,"created_at":"2016-02-05T18:55:18.289307Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T18:55:31.971913Z","location":{"id":835,"zipcode":"95616","city":"Davis","county":"Yolo","state":"CA","lon":-121.64,"lat":38.48},"content":"I work at school.
